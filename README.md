# Artificer (UA 2024) Booklet

This booklet is derived from the **Unearthed Arcana 2024** playtest content for the **Artificer** class in Dungeons & Dragons, transformed into an easily printable A5 booklet with images.

### What This Is
I do **not** own any of the original content. This is a fan-made edit of the official UA PDF. I have added images, formatted the layout to fit two pages horizontally on each printed sheet, and modified the covers for a cleaner presentation.

### Credits and Sources  
- **Main Content:** from UA 2024 (playtest material)  
- **Images:** from [https://i.4pcdn.org/tg/1493789345926.pdf](https://i.4pcdn.org/tg/1493789345926.pdf)  
- **Front Cover:** from *Eberron: Forge of the Artificer*  
- **Back Cover:** by [Anthony Lorente](https://www.artstation.com/anthony_lm)  

This booklet aims to help Dungeon Masters and players quickly reference the Artificer class and its subclasses in a compact, visually appealing format.
